This is a simple chess game, it's a work in progress, and it might not have 
all the features of chess. My  goal is for it to have most features, such as en 
passant, castling, and promotions, but I may have to limit promotion to auto
promote to a queen. I may try to add a button for promotions further down the line.

After getting the UI set up I want to add a working chess bot, but this may or may not happen.
